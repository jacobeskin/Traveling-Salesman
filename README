Travelling salesman problem with Simulated Annealing.

This prject solves the travelling salesman problem with monte carlo simulated
annealing method.

The code asks for a letter from a-c, depending which scheme given in the 
assingment one wants to run. The code is not the prettiest, simulated annealing
routine is written for each shceme separately so the code is long. T_o is 
chosen to be 10000, in 10000000 steps the T is lowered linearly to 0.1T_o, 
and after this T_o is set as 0.8T_o and another 10000000 steps are simulated. 
This is done 100 times. Arrays named 'indx' and 'distances' contain the 
information of the sequence of points and their distances from each other.
Some total distances of the routes are printed into data files for plotting,
and some plots are included called caseA, caseB, caseC for cases 
a, b, c respectively; plots are of total value of function to be minimized
versus simulation steps.

compilaion: make -f makesiman

Running for a):

$ ./SimulatedEx.exe 
Seed from /dev/urandom: 282062966

 Scheme a, b or c?
a

 Name of datafile that has the points?
cities
 How many points?
20

Similarly for b) and c), but with data file cities.

Code prints out distance travelled and code running time. Also for case a),
total time spent travelling is printed out and the order in which the cities 
where visited (total time includes sales of vacuums). Result for case a) is:

Mikkeli        

 Jyvaskyla      

 Kuopio         

 Joensuu        

 Kajaani        

 Oulu           

 Vaasa          

 Pori           

 Rauma          

 Turku          

 Tampere        

 Hameenlinna    

 Lahti          

 Hyvinkaa       

 Vantaa         

 Espoo          

 Helsinki       

 Porvoo         

 Kotka          

 Lappeenranta   
 Distance travelled:
   1926.0643777172113     
 Time taken:
   5.9595970087168340     

After multiple runs, the distance travelled, time taken and order of cities 
remained the same. The order might be reversed though and the starting city
may be different at different runs, but these do not affect the distance and 
time. Distance is in kilometers and time in hours.
